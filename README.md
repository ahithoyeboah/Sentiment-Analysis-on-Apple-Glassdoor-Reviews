#### Background
##### Introduction
Apple Inc. is a well-known technology business that creates, markets, and distributes consumer devices, computer hardware, software, and online services. Apple Inc. has a large workforce and is known for its customer-centric strategy. It has a huge global presence and reputation. As a result, employee comments and evaluations on sites like Glassdoor.com play an important role in moulding the company's image among job seekers, investors, and the public. Online reviews and feedback have gained importance in recent years, as they may have a substantial impact on a company's reputation, brand impression, and overall performance. 
Employee reviews provide insights into current and former employees' experiences, thoughts, and attitudes, providing essential feedback on different elements of the organisation such as work culture, salary, management, and job satisfaction. Analysing and comprehending the sentiments stated in employee reviews can provide significant information to firms such as Apple Inc., allowing them to make informed decisions and increase employee satisfaction, retention, and overall company success. 
Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, is a popular natural language processing (NLP) technique that includes analysing text data to detect the sentiment or emotional tone of the text. There are several methods for sentiment analysis, such as the Bag of Words methodology, which includes encoding text data as a collection of words without regard for the order or structure of the text. Other approaches include, among others, machine learning algorithms, sentiment lexicons, and deep learning techniques. In this project, we will apply the Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and the TextBlob libraries to perform sentiment analysis on Apple Inc. employee reviews and evaluate their performance.



##### Objective
The main objective of this project The goal was to assess the sentiment expressed in these reviews and evaluate Apple's overall performance as an employer.

##### Methods
The NLTK VADER library provided a pre-trained sentiment analysis model specifically designed for social media text, which allowed me to determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review. This analysis provided insights into the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction of Apple employees.

Additionally, I employed the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis and extract additional features such as subjectivity, which measures the degree of personal opinion in a given review. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the sentiments expressed by employees.

Furthermore, in addition to sentiment analysis, I conducted topic modeling to identify common themes and topics discussed in the reviews. By applying techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), I was able to extract the main topics that emerged from the reviews. This analysis provided a deeper understanding of the key areas of interest or concern among Apple employees.


##### Conclusion
This sentiment analysis project using Python, NLTK VADER, TextBlob, and topic modeling techniques enabled a comprehensive evaluation of Apple's employee reviews on Glassdoor. By analyzing sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and identifying dominant topics, the project shed light on the overall sentiment and key areas of focus within the Apple employee community.
